What was used:
  - [![Unity Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/unity-2018.4.21-blue.svg)](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download)
  - [![MRTK Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/Microsoft-MRTK%202.4.0-green)](https://github.com/microsoft/MixedRealityToolkit-Unity/releases/tag/v2.4.0)
  - Hololens 1st gen.
  - Magic
  - [UnityFBXExporter](https://github.com/KellanHiggins/UnityFBXExporter)
***
How to use it:
  - This only works with Unity XR remote right now.
  - After the Mesh appears, just click on the save button, and the save directory will be written to the log.
  - Blender doesn't take ASCII FBX files. You will need converting the ascii fbx in the binary fbx.

> I needed to scan the room to avoid constantly using unity remote. And it did what I needed it to do.
